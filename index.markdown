## About

PennController for Ibex (also called PCIbex or PennController) provides the tools to build and run online experiments, from familiar paradigms like self-paced reading to completely custom-designed paradigms. Experiments can be uploaded to or imported from GitHub, making it easy to collaborate and share experiments.

PCIbex was developed and is maintained by [Jeremy Zehr](https://sites.google.com/site/jeremyezehr/home){:target="_blank"} and [Florian Schwarz](https://www.florianschwarz.net/){:target="_blank"} as an extension of [Ibex](https://github.com/addrummond/ibex/blob/master/docs/manual.md){:target="_blank"}, a JavaScript-based experiment platform by [Alex Drummond](https://adrummond.net/){:target="_blank"}. PCIbex uses a stream-lined code interface and requires no background in JavaScript. 

PCIbex is under a BSD license, and its source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/PennController/penncontroller){:target="_blank"}. Its development was partly funded through a University Research Foundation Research Grant from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} and currently is supported by the [ILST initiative at MindCORE](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/){:target="_blank"}.
