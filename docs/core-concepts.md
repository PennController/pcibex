## Overview

The **Core Concepts** guide teaches you how to build a PCIbex experiment, from writing the actual experiment script to running the experiment on the PCIbex Farm server. Each section builds on information introduced in the previous section, so it's recommended to read the four sections in order. 

## Knowledge prerequisites

PCIbex does not require any knowledge of JavaScript or background in programming. However, you should have a basic understanding of the following terms and concepts: 
+ Terms
  + Command
