Each PCIbex Farm account has a **64MB storage quota**, meaning that the total size of all files across all experiments cannot exceed 64MB. If you exceed this limit, you will not be able to upload new files or save any changes.

To restore your account:
+ Delete files until total file size is under 64MB.
+ Send an email to [support@pcibex.net](mailto:support@pcibex.net) to be taken off the exceed-quota list.
